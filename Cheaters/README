# Welcome to Anissa's and Pragna's Plagarism Checker
------------------------------------------------

#Introduction
-- this code simulates Turnitin
-- there are multiple files which will need to be downloaded so that you can check which files are being plagarized
-- this code will implement a hash table that will have a linked list that comprise of all the files that have similar sections
-- there is also a matrix which holds the total number of collisions of all the files

#Installations
-- must download all the documents needed to be run through to compare the files
-- to compile the program simply press make
-- to run the code ./plagiarismCatcher path/to/files 6 200
-- the number 6 can be changed to check a larger of a chunk of words or a smaller chunk of words
-- the number 200 can also be changed, that number represents the minimum number of collisions
in order to be outputted

#Reminders
-- if you change the chunk number to a smaller number there will be more file matches generated 
because there will be a relatively more collisions as the comparision amount is less and vice
versa if the chunk number is made larger
-- if you change the minimum collision number to be smaller there also maybe more file matches generated 
and vice versa if the number is increased
-- make sure you are running it on the most updated version of Linux

#Extra
-- thank you for a great semester! :)
-- have a good break!
